# Design of Protein Binder for Active Targeting of NCAM1

*Note: the full manuscript is in a private repo*

Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer (NEPC) is a rare, aggressive form of prostate cancer with a 5 year survival
rate of less than 20% (Rao et al., 2012). Therapeutics can be delivered via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) functionalized with
binders that are specific to differentially expressed receptor proteins on the membrane of NEPC cells, such as
NCAM1. No NCAM1 binder small enough to be used with an LNP has been created for NEPC targeting. We
designed and tested four binders to a known binding domain of NCAM1. The binders were generated
computationally and heuristically and then tested in vitro. Our binding assay results did not indicate that any of
the de novo binders targeted the NCAM1 domain of interest with high efficacy. Future studies will focus more
on homology-based antibody design of NCAM1 binders while further experimenting with emerging de novo
methods.
